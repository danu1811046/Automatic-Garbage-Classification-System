# Automatic Garbage Classification System using Arduino Based-Controller and Binary Tree Concept
Automatic Garbage Classification System using Arduino-Based Controller that can open automatically and classify 3 (three) types of garbage: 
- metal, 
- organic, 
- and inorganic garbage.

This system consisting of an inductive proximity sensor and capacitive proximity sensor as garbage type detector, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor as an object detector, servo motors as actuators of garbage classification, and Arduino mega 2568 as the microcontroller.
